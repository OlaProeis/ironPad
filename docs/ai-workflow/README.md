# AI-Assisted Development: How Ironpad Was Built

Ironpad was built entirely using AI-assisted development. Not just the code -- the architecture, the PRD, the task breakdowns, and the debugging were all done through structured collaboration with AI models.

We share this process openly as part of the **Open Method** philosophy: not just open source code, but open development process.

| [method.md](method.md) | The complete AI development workflow: PRD-first, task decomposition, handover system |
| [tools.md](tools.md) | Every tool used, how it fits in, and why |
| [lessons-learned.md](lessons-learned.md) | What worked, what didn't, and the 200K to 1M context window shift |

## Key Takeaway

The tools keep getting better, but **the process of using them well still matters**. A 1 million token context window doesn't help if you don't know what to ask for. Structure your work, be specific, maintain context, verify results.
